# javascript and classes

* What is a Class?
- A class in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating objects. It groups related properties and methods into a single structure.

* Why use Classes?
- Classes support object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction, making code more reusable and organized.

* How Classes Work:
- Introduced in ES6 (2015)
- Internally based on prototypes, but provides a cleaner syntax.

## OOP

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects, which contain data (properties) and behavior (methods).

- JavaScript supports OOP using:
Objects
Prototypes
Classes (ES6)

## why use OOP
- code get messup and do not get reused

## object
- Collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## parts of OOP
Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- classes
- Instances(new, this) 

## 4 Pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
